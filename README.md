# ðŸ§¼ Data Cleansing & Profiling Techniques

Data cleansing and profiling are crucial steps in ensuring high-quality, accurate, and consistent data for analysis. Below are the key steps involved:

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Profiling
Analyze and assess data quality before processing:
- **Structure Analysis:** Check data types, formats, and schema consistency.
- **Completeness Check:** Identify missing values and measure data completeness.
- **Uniqueness Check:** Detect duplicate records and redundant entries.
- **Range & Distribution Analysis:** Identify outliers and inconsistencies.
- **Dependency Analysis:** Ensure relationships between datasets are valid.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Data Cleansing
Improve data accuracy and reliability:
- **Handling Missing Data:**
  - Fill with mean, median, mode, or interpolation.
  - Remove incomplete records if necessary.
- **Removing Duplicates:**
  - Identify and delete duplicate records.
- **Correcting Inconsistencies:**
  - Standardize formats (e.g., date formats, categorical values).
  - Fix incorrect spellings or misclassifications.
- **Outlier Detection & Treatment:**
  - Use statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR) to detect anomalies.
  - Remove or adjust extreme values based on business rules.
- **Data Normalization & Standardization:**
  - Scale numeric data (Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization).
  - Convert categorical data into consistent formats.
- **Validation & Integrity Checks:**
  - Ensure foreign key relationships are intact.
  - Apply business rules to verify correctness.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Data Documentation
Maintain records of all data cleansing steps:
- Keep logs of modifications made to datasets.
- Document assumptions, transformations, and validation rules.

### âœ… Following these steps ensures clean, structured, and high-quality data for analysis! ðŸš€
